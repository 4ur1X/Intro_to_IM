#### TunesUI MP3 Player

**Description**

My plan is to create an MP3 player with a really cool UI and visualizer, which will have more features (that I feel would be helpful for users). It will use all the functionalities learnt in the class until now and some extra ones. More details coming soon . . .

**June 8**

- My first step is to draw / plan out the intitial layout of the screen and the colors that will be used.
- I will try to start coding for either the visualizer part or song progress bar today as I feel these are going to be a bit challenging compared to other features.
- Here is the initial screen (with hover effect) after running the program.

**June 9**

- I will continue to work on the song progress bar.
- PLAY screen will be completed by today.
