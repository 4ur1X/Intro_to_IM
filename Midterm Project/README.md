#### TunesUI MP3 Player

**Description**

My plan is to create an MP3 player with a really cool UI and visualizer, which will have more features (that I feel would be helpful for users). There'll be preloaded songs from which the user can select or switch from. Default buttons like play, pause, next, fast-forward etc. will all be implemented. The canvas dimensions are similar to a mobile screen. The program will use all the functionalities learnt in the class until now and some extra ones. More details coming soon . . .

- My first step is to draw / plan and figure out the intitial layout of the screen and the colors that will be used along with designing the logo.
- I will try to start coding for either the visualizer part or song progress bar today as I feel these are going to be a bit challenging compared to other features.
- Here is the initial screen (with hover effect) after running the program. Click functionality not added yet.

- I will continue to work on the song progress bar and add click functionality for the two options i.e. Play and Explore to direct the users to respective screens.
- PLAY screen will be completed by today.
- I'll explore and gather specific images and songs to be used in the program.
