#### NASCAR Circuit Training Game - Make and Break your Own Record!

**Description**

My main idea is to implement a **training scenario** that F1 racers go through before actually racing on the final track with other racers. 

The objective of the player is to complete maximum number of laps in a limited time by testing various parameters (by changing steering sensitivity, speed, etc.) to get the best possible time record of the fastest lap. The high score will be stored / saved in a file, so that it gets updated as soon as the record is broken.

- several race track venues to choose from.
- drive through difficult corners.
- modify your car
  - change the steering sensitivity
  - increase the acceleration
  - change the car’s maximum speed
  - modify the car’s look and sound
    (etc . . .)


The following components for Arduino will be used:

- **Potentiometer** : will use it like a steering wheel.
- **LCD Screen** : to digitally display the car speed dynamically (like a speedometer) and total lap time.
- **Button 1** : to accelerate the car forward.
- **Button 2** : to apply brake.
- **Button 3** : Nitro / Boost.
- **Button 4** : Horn.
- **Buzzer Tone** : to output horn (beep) sound.

I think I'll need to use all of the Processing items / functions for my game.

**TODAY'S TASKS**

My today's task included designing different screens for the game i.e. initial screen, story screen, choose mode screen, and choose track screen.
I also added background music and mouse click functionality to navigate to all of those screens. 

To navigate to the initial screen directly, one can press the 'X' key. Below is the GIF of today's completed task.

## July 1

**TODAY'S TASKS**

- I'll work on "customize" screen and add all the modification properties for the car.
- I'll also work on the most important component of the game i.e. actual gameplay screen.
- I might design different race tracks as well.

I could finish customize screen today and accomplish most of the part for actual gameplay (still incomplete). I couldn't work on designing the race tracks, so I'll continue with it the next day.
