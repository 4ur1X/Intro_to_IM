## Final Project by Ronit

#### NASCAR Circuit Training Game 2D

**Description** : This is a car simulator game that imitates a race training scenario that Nascar or F1 drivers go through before actually making it out to the actual race with other racers. The game features two separate modes (that the player can choose):
- **Max Lap Mode** : To cover the maximum number of laps in a limited given time.
- **Fastest Lap Mode** : To cover only one lap, but in the least possible time.

The player's job is to customize and optimize his / her car's performance (increase speed or steering sensitivity) to beat his own previous record.

The player can choose from three different tracks as well.

The game has to be played using the three buttons (to accelerate forward, apply nitro, horn respectively) and a potentiometer for steering the car.

This is the completed circuit (first), game screens (second), gameplay (third):

## Takeaways and Conclusion

This project was one of my dream projects since childhood. I am an avid car enthusiast and I've always wanted to make a car game like this. Integrating it with Arduino components (instead of the usual keyboard controls) made it even more fun to make and play. The journalling process was really helpful as well because I knew exactly what to work on a particular day. I didn't try to go beyond the tasks assigned for a particular day even though I completed it and had some time left. It made me stay organized.
