#### F1 Car Lap Game

**Description**

My main idea is to implement a **training scenario** that F1 racers go through before actually racing on the final track with other racers. 

The objective of the player is to complete a number of laps in a limited time by testing various parameters (by changing steering sensitivity, speed, etc.) to get the best possible time record of the fastest lap. The high score will be stored / saved in a file, so that it gets updated as soon as the record is broken.

**The player will have the option to** :

- several race track venues to choose from.
- drive through difficult corners.
- modify your car (color, increase steering sensitivity, increase max. speed, choose from different horns).

The following components for Arduino will be used:

- **Potentiometer** : will use it like a steering wheel.
- **LCD Screen** : to digitally display the car speed dynamically (like a speedometer) and total points.
- **Button 1** : to accelerate the car forward.
- **Button 2** : to apply brake.
- **Button 3** : Nitro / Boost.
- **Button 4** : Horn.
- **Buzzer Tone** : to output horn (beep) sound.

I think I'll need to use all of the Processing items / functions for my game.
