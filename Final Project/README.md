#### 2D Car Simulator Game

**Description**

My main idea is making a car game with a race track, with an objective to collect as many coins **(autocoins)** as possible.

**Features (as of now):**

- many race tracks to choose from.
- collect autocoins.
- modify car (increase steering sensitivity, increase max. speed, choose from different horns) with the autocoins.

The following components for Arduino will be used:

- **Potentiometer** : will use it like a steering wheel.
- **LCD Screen** : to digitally display the car speed dynamically (like a speedometer).
- **Button 1** : to accelerate the car forward.
- **Button 2** : to apply brake.
- **Button 3** : Nitro / Boost.
- **Button 4** : Horn.
- **Buzzer Tone** : to output horn (beep) sound.

I think I'll need to use all of the Processing items / functions for my game.
