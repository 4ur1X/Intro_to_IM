#### NASCAR Circuit Training Game 2D

**Description** : This is a car simulator game that imitates a race training scenario that Nascar or F1 drivers go through before actually making it out to the actual race with other racers. The game features two separate modes (that the player can choose):
- **Max Lap Mode** : To cover the maximum number of laps in a limited given time.
- **Fastest Lap Mode** : To cover only one lap, but in the least possible time.

The player's job is to customize and optimize his / her car's performance (increase speed or steering sensitivity) to beat his own previous record.

The player can choose from three different tracks as well.
