#### F1 Circuit Racing Game

**Description**

My main idea is making a car game with a race track, with an objective to collect as many coins **(autocoins)** as possible.  

The following components for Arduino will be used:

- **Potentiometer** : will use it like a steering wheel.
- **Button 1** : to accelerate the car forward.
- **Button 2** : to apply brake.
- **Button 3** : Nitro / Boost.
- **Button 4** : Horn.
- **Buzzer** : to output horn (beep) sound.
