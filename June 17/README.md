**Description**

- **Analog Sensor :** When the room lights are on, the LED glows **GREEN**. When the room lights are off, the LED glows **RED**.
- **Digital Sensor :** When the switch / button is pressed, the LEDs blink consecutively in either of the above state.

Below is the **schematic** of the circuit :
