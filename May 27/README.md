**Reflection :** 
- I have used for() loop to randomly place all the hundred stars (points) and set speed of each.
- Moreover, I used while() loop to achieve movement of the stars towards the left.
- Other than that, I also added some extra code for background music (thanks to my previous experience in Intro to CS class), spaceship images and texts on the screen.
