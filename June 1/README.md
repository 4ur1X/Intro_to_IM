###  Creating an artwork with the help of OOP concepts in Processing.

#### BUBBLE ART

Below is the GIF of the resultant artwork :

**Class used:**
- ````Bubbles````: It contains a variable to keep track of number of bubbles and a constructor to initialise it based on user input. There is also a function as given below.

**Functions used:**
- ````makeBubbles()````: To create bubbles according to user's choice of the total number (initialisation through constructor).

**NOTE:** This time I tried to create a simple artwork instead of creating a game. Using OOP concept while programming made the code look structured and easier to read compared to how I used to code before only using functions. Moreover, because of the constructor, user can input his desired number of bubbles to be shown on the screen.
