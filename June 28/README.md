**Description**

- The game's objective is to **get more hits than misses** in a maximum time of **30 seconds**. 
- The ball bounces itself, but the player can move the platform left or right using the two buttons on the breadboard.
- There is a timer on top-right corner that updates (decrements) itself every 1 second.
- The live score can be seen in the top-left corner.
- To **RESTART** the game (either in between or after game over), you can click anywhere on the canvas with the mouse, or press **'SPACE'** key. 

Below is the **schematic** of the circuit :
